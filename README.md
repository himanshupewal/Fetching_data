#   Fetching Data and Methods
This project provides powerful capabilities for fetching data from various sources. Whether you need to retrieve information from APIs, databases, or third-party services, this project offers flexible methods to accomplish your data fetching needs.

##  Supported Data Sources
* APIs: Fetch data directly from APIs using HTTP requests. The project supports common RESTful APIs and can handle various authentication methods, such as API keys, OAuth, or token-based authentication.

* Databases: Connect to databases and execute SQL queries to retrieve data. The project supports a wide range of database systems, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more. It provides an intuitive and consistent interface to interact with different databases.

* Third-Party Services: Integrate with popular third-party services that offer APIs for data retrieval. This project includes pre-built modules and wrappers for seamless interaction with services like Twitter, Google Maps, or GitHub.

* Fetching Methods
API Fetching: Utilize the api_fetcher module to fetch data from APIs. The module provides functions for making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, handling request headers, query parameters, and request bodies.

* Database Querying: Use the database_connector module to connect to databases and execute SQL queries. The module abstracts the connection establishment and query execution, providing a simple interface to interact with databases and retrieve the desired data.

* Third-Party Service Integration: Employ the service_integration module to integrate with popular third-party services. The module encapsulates the authentication process, request generation, and response handling for smooth interaction with services' APIs.
